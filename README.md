# Shorty
The Weekend project URL shortner

## Why?

  Learning new technologies is fun.  I wanted to learn Go, and while working through several videos and books, I decided a URL shortner would be a fun and handy project.

## What?

  - Basic URL shortning.  301 redirect based on route.
  - File Download.  Writes file directly to browser.

## What's missing (todo)

  - Better error handling.
  - Useful logging
  - Metrics (how many clicks for URL, how many short urls do we have in the data store, ect...)
  - Easier way to add new shortcut
  - Cleanup (extract handlers, figure out what's going on with the types - may be overcomplicating things based on the use case)
